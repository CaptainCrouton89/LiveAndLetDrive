A note on the programming:
This was my first delve into Godot, and it was built on a time crunch. The code is messy, and ugly, and not representative of my usual care to detail. I knew the constraints of the project, and knew I could get away with sloppy code. However, when building a larger game, I use better programming practices so that the game doesn't fall apart half way through the project. If you want to see higher quality game code, please check out my github portfolio and look at Star Theory Port Over, in the Phaser Projects folder. https://github.com/CaptainCrouton89/Portfolio/tree/main/Phaser%20Projects/Star%20Theory%20PortOver
